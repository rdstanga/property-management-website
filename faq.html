                <h3>Q: Do you accept pets?</h3>
                <p>A: Simply put, no. Pets are a common reason for expensive damage to homes. They also pose a risk to people other than the pet's owner entering the property, even after the tenant and pet have vacated the property (allergic reactions to fur/dander and to those with compromised breathing).</p>
